<h1>Emily Elizabeth Mason</h1>
<p>
  I'm looking for a remote role with a forward thinking company, where the
  customer experience and their business outcomes are at the heart of what I do.
  With a background in network solution design & sales, I have experience
  identifying the customer's technical landscape and effectively qualifying
  opportunities, documenting and presenting technical solutions, and approving
  customer designs.
  <br />
  As an 80's kid with a passion for gaming and 90's nostalgia, I moderate for a
  couple of Twitch streamers in my spare time, I love catching up with my
  friends online, and keeping upto date with the latest tech! I live in Ibiza
  with my husband, where I enjoy exploring the island and making new
  connections. I also have a deep love for travel and learning about different
  cultures, and welcoming friends and family to spend their holidays with us.
