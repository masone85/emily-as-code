== ABOUT ME
<br />
* I'm looking for a remote role with a forward thinking company, where the
customer experience and their business outcomes are at the heart of what I do.
With a background in network solution design & sales, I have experience
identifying the customer's technical landscape and effectively qualifying
opportunities, documenting and presenting technical solutions, and approving
customer designs.
<br />
* As an 80's kid with a passion for gaming and 90's nostalgia, I moderate for a
couple of Twitch streamers in my spare time, I love catching up with my friends
online, and keeping upto date with the latest tech! I live in Ibiza with my
husband, where I enjoy exploring the island and making new connections. I also
have a deep love for travel and learning about different cultures, and welcoming
friends and family to spend their holidays with us.
<br />
