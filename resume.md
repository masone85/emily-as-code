## Additional Information

As an 80's kid with a passion for gaming and 90's nostalgia, I moderate for a
couple of Twitch streamers in my spare time, I love catching up with my friends
online, and keeping up to date with the latest tech! I live in Ibiza with my
husband, where I enjoy exploring the island and making new connections. I also
have a deep love for travel and learning about different cultures, and welcoming
friends and family to spend their holidays with us.
